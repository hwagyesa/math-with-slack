# Fork of fsavje's `math-with-slack` script with macros added

This repo consists of some changes to fsavje's script to add
support for using macros with `math-with-slack`, as well as a
default set of macros.

Please see the README in fsavje's [repo](https://github.com/fsavje/math-with-slack)
for a much more detailed introduction to `math-with-slack` as
well as credits for contributions.

Thanks to [LaurentHayez](https://github.com/LaurentHayez) for
